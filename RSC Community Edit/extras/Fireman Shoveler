    #Setup:
    #Wire TenderButton to a button in or around the tender. This will be used to shovel coal.
    #Wire FireboxButton to a button around the firebox. This is where the coal will be thrown. Who'da thunk?
    #Wire AddCoal on RSC to the E2.
    #The shovel entity wire is purely cosmetic. You can wire it to a shovel model so it goes invisible when you're shoveling.
